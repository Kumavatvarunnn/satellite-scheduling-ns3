# Satellite Network Scheduling (Internship Work Snippets)

This repository contains selected code snippets and simulation files from my internship at IIST Thiruvananthapuram. The project focused on optimal scheduling in satellite constellations to reduce communication latency. Due to research restrictions, not all code is included here â€” but this reflects my approach and contribution.

### Tools Used
- NS-3
- Python
- Qiskit (for Quantum Key Distribution exploration)

### Topics Explored
- Satellite subsystems and communication models
- Network latency optimization
- Quantum communication basics
